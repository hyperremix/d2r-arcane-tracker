## Introduction

### What is the Holy Grail Challenge?

The **Holy Grail** is one of the most prestigious endgame challenges in Diablo II: Resurrected. The goal is deceptively simple: find every unique and set item that can drop in the game through legitimate gameplay. Unlike other endgame goals that focus on character optimization or speed-running, the Holy Grail is a marathon of exploration, farming, and persistence.

The challenge requires:

- **Self-found items only** - Items must be found by your own characters
- **No trading** - Trading defeats the purpose of the challenge
- **No dupes** - Only legitimately dropped items count
- **Completion** - Finding every single unique and set item in the game

The traditional Holy Grail focuses on unique and set items, though many players extend the challenge to include runes and runewords as well.

### Why Pursue the Holy Grail?

Players undertake the Holy Grail challenge for several compelling reasons:

#### Long-term Goal

Unlike completing the game or reaching level 99, the Holy Grail provides a concrete, achievable (though difficult) long-term objective that can take hundreds or even thousands of hours to complete.

#### Comprehensive Game Experience

The challenge forces you to:

- Farm all areas of the game
- Build multiple characters for different farming routes
- Experience the full depth of D2R's item system
- Master magic find optimization
- Learn monster and area mechanics

#### Community Recognition

Completing the Holy Grail is recognized as a significant achievement in the D2R community. Many players share their progress through streams, videos, or tracker screenshots.

#### Personal Satisfaction

There's an undeniable satisfaction in:

- Finally finding that last elusive item
- Watching your completion percentage slowly climb
- Hitting major milestones (50%, 75%, 90%, etc.)
- The dopamine rush when a rare unique drops

#### Replayability

The challenge gives purpose to farming runs that might otherwise feel repetitive. Each run is a chance to check another item off the list.

### History and Community

The Holy Grail challenge originated in the classic Diablo II community and has been a staple endgame pursuit for over two decades.

#### Origins

- The term "Holy Grail" was coined by the D2 community to represent the ultimate collection quest
- Early trackers were simple spreadsheets or text files
- Players would manually check off items as they found them
- The challenge gained popularity through forums like Diabloii.net and Reddit's r/diablo2

#### Modern Era

With Diablo II: Resurrected, the Holy Grail has experienced a renaissance:

- Automated tracking tools like D2R Arcane Tracker have made progress tracking seamless
- Streaming platforms have brought more visibility to Grail runs
- The remaster's improved graphics make rare items even more exciting to find
- Cross-platform play has expanded the community of Grail hunters

#### Notable Achievements

- Some players have completed multiple Grails across different game modes
- Hardcore Holy Grails are considered especially challenging due to character permadeath
- "Speedrun Grails" where players race to complete the Grail as quickly as possible have emerged
- The community celebrates major item finds, especially the rarest drops

---

## Holy Grail Categories

The D2R Arcane Tracker organizes Holy Grail items into several main categories. Understanding these categories helps you track progress and target specific items.

### Unique Items

**Unique items** are the core of the Holy Grail challenge. These are one-of-a-kind items with fixed stats and unique properties.

#### Characteristics

- Orange/gold text color in-game
- Fixed names (e.g., Shako, Windforce, Stone of Jordan)
- Predetermined stats with minor variance
- Can drop from monsters within their treasure class
- Some can only drop from specific monsters or areas

#### Quantity

There are over 300 unique items in Diablo II: Resurrected, spanning all equipment slots and item types.

#### Rarity Spectrum

Unique items range from:

- **Common**: Frequently found during normal gameplay (e.g., Hotspur, Sigon's set pieces)
- **Rare**: Require dedicated farming (e.g., Harlequin Crest, War Traveler)
- **Very Rare**: Exceptionally difficult to find (e.g., Azurewrath, Death's Web)
- **Extremely Rare**: Can take thousands of hours (e.g., Tyrael's Might, Mang Song's Lesson)

The tracker categorizes these items by weapon type, armor type, jewelry, and charms for easier organization.

### Set Items

**Set items** are green-colored items that provide additional bonuses when worn together as a complete set.

#### Characteristics

- Green text color in-game
- Belong to named sets (e.g., Tal Rasha's Wrappings, Immortal King)
- Individual pieces provide standard bonuses
- Wearing multiple pieces from the same set grants set bonuses
- Full set completion often provides powerful synergies

#### Organization

The tracker organizes set items by:

- **Set name**: All pieces from the same set are grouped together
- **Item type**: Categorized by whether they're weapons, armor, or jewelry
- **Completion status**: Easily see which sets you've completed

#### Total Count

There are approximately 30 item sets in D2R, with varying numbers of pieces per set (typically 2-6 items per set).

#### Rarity

Set items also vary in rarity:

- Some sets are commonly found (Sigon's, Cleglaw's)
- Others require significant farming (Tal Rasha's, Immortal King)
- A few pieces are extremely rare (e.g., Griswold's Honor)

### Runes

**Runes** are socketable items that can be combined to create runewords. They're optional for Holy Grail tracking but many purists include them.

#### Why Track Runes?

- Completes the "find everything" goal
- Runes are integral to D2R's endgame
- High runes are exceptionally rare and valuable
- Adds significant challenge to the Grail

#### Rune Hierarchy

Runes are organized from El (#1) to Zod (#33):

- **Low Runes** (El through Amn): Common drops
- **Mid Runes** (Sol through Mal): Moderate rarity
- **High Runes** (Ist through Zod): Rare and extremely valuable

#### Tracking Considerations

In D2R Arcane Tracker, you can enable or disable rune tracking based on your preference. Many players:

- Track high runes only (Ist+)
- Track all runes for completeness
- Skip runes to focus on uniques and sets

### Runewords

**Runewords** are created by inserting specific runes in a specific order into socketed items. Like runes, they're optional for tracking.

#### Why Track Runewords?

- Represents crafting achievements
- Shows mastery of the runeword system
- Adds a crafting dimension to the Grail
- Some runewords are build-defining

#### Considerations

Runewords differ from other Grail items:

- They're **crafted**, not found
- Requires having specific runes
- Requires appropriate base items
- Can be created multiple times

#### Tracking in D2R Arcane Tracker

The tracker allows you to mark runewords as "created" when you successfully craft them, providing a separate collection goal beyond finding items.

## Using D2R Arcane Tracker

D2R Arcane Tracker automates the Holy Grail tracking process, monitoring your save files and updating your progress as you play.

### Initial Setup

When you first launch D2R Arcane Tracker, you'll need to configure it to monitor your Diablo II: Resurrected save files.

#### Locating Your Save Directory

```
%USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected
```

Typical full path:

```
C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected
```

#### Configuration Steps

1. **Launch the Application**: Open D2R Arcane Tracker
2. **Navigate to Settings**: Click the Settings icon (gear icon)
3. **Find Database Settings**: Look for the save file directory configuration
4. **Browse to Your Save Directory**: Click "Browse" or "Select Folder"
5. **Confirm the Path**: Ensure the path points to the folder containing your `.d2s` character files
6. **Apply Settings**: Save your configuration

#### Verifying Setup

Once configured, the tracker should:

- Detect existing characters
- Display them in the character list
- Show any items already in their inventories and stashes
- Begin monitoring for changes

If characters don't appear:

- Double-check the save directory path
- Ensure you have at least one character created in D2R
- Check file permissions (the tracker needs read access)
- Restart the application

### Game Mode Configuration

D2R Arcane Tracker supports multiple game modes to accommodate different playstyles.

#### Available Game Modes

**Both Softcore & Hardcore**

- Tracks items from all characters regardless of hardcore status
- Ideal for players who play both modes
- Provides the most comprehensive tracking
- Default recommended setting

**Softcore Only**

- Tracks only items from softcore (non-hardcore) characters
- For players who exclusively play softcore
- Filters out any hardcore character items

**Hardcore Only**

- Tracks only items from hardcore characters
- For dedicated hardcore Holy Grail runners
- More challenging due to permadeath risk
- Separates hardcore achievements from softcore

**Manual Entry**

- Disables automatic save file monitoring
- Allows manual item entry only
- Useful for:
  - Tracking items across multiple accounts
  - Playing on platforms without save file access
  - Theorycrafting or planning
  - Tracking found items without automatic detection

#### Changing Game Mode

1. Open **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Game Mode** section
3. Select your preferred mode from the dropdown
4. Changes take effect immediately
5. Progress statistics will update to reflect the selected mode

#### Important Considerations

- Changing game modes affects what items are counted toward completion
- Switching from "Both" to "Softcore Only" will hide hardcore-found items (but not delete them)
- Manual mode disables automatic detection entirely
- You can change modes at any time without losing data

### Game Version Selection

The tracker supports both modern and classic versions of Diablo II.

#### Available Versions

**Diablo II: Resurrected**

- Modern remaster with enhanced graphics
- Updated save file format
- Quality of life improvements
- Default setting for most users
- Full feature support

**Diablo II: Classic**

- Original Diablo II with Lord of Destruction
- Legacy save file format
- For players still on the original game
- Compatible with older save files

#### Version Differences

The game version setting affects:

- Save file parsing compatibility
- Item detection algorithms
- Expected file formats
- Treasure class data

#### Selecting Your Version

1. Open **Settings**
2. Find **Game Version** section
3. Choose between Resurrected or Classic
4. The tracker will adjust its parsing accordingly

**Note**: Most users should select "Diablo II: Resurrected" unless specifically playing the original game.

### Tracking Options

Customize what types of items count toward your Holy Grail completion.

#### Normal Items (Default: Enabled)

The standard Holy Grail includes all unique and set items in their normal (non-ethereal) form.

- **Enabled**: Track all normal unique and set items
- **Recommended**: Always enabled for traditional Holy Grail

#### Ethereal Items (Default: Disabled)

Ethereal items are special versions with +50% defense (armor) or damage (weapons) but cannot be repaired (unless they have self-repair property).

**Tracking Options:**

- **Disabled**: Don't track ethereal variants (traditional Grail)
- **Enabled**: Track ethereal versions separately

**Considerations for Ethereal Tracking:**

- Roughly doubles the number of items to find
- Significantly increases challenge difficulty
- Some items can only drop ethereal (these always count)

**How Ethereal Tracking Works:**

- Some items can have both normal and ethereal versions
- The tracker shows separate checkboxes or indicators
- You need to find both versions for 100% completion

#### Runes (Default: Disabled)

Enable rune tracking to include all 33 runes in your Grail.

**When to Enable:**

- You want a complete "find everything" challenge
- High rune farming is part of your goals
- You enjoy the additional tracking dimension

**When to Disable:**

- You prefer the traditional unique/set-only Grail
- Runes feel too numerous or common
- You want to focus on equipment items only

**Tracking Behavior:**

- Tracks runes from El (#1) to Zod (#33)
- Each rune only needs to be found once
- Runes in your stash/inventory are automatically detected
- Progress percentage includes runes when enabled

#### Runewords (Default: Disabled)

Track crafted runewords as part of your collection.

**When to Enable:**

- You enjoy the crafting aspect of D2R
- You want to document your runeword achievements
- You collect perfect or notable runeword bases

**When to Disable:**

- You prefer self-found items only
- Runewords feel like "cheating" since they're crafted
- You want to focus on finding, not making

**Tracking Behavior:**

- Tracks which runewords you've successfully made
- Progress percentage includes runewords when enabled

#### Customizing Your Grail

Common configurations:

- **Traditional**: Normal items only, no runes/runewords
- **Extended**: Normal + Ethereal items
- **Complete**: Everything including runes
- **Purist**: Uniques and sets only, no runes/runewords
- **Custom**: Any combination that suits your goals

Changes to tracking options update your progress statistics immediately.

### Automatic Item Detection

The tracker's most powerful feature is automatic detection of items from your save files.

#### How It Works

1. **File Monitoring**: The tracker continuously monitors your save file directory
2. **Change Detection**: When save files are modified, the tracker detects changes
3. **File Parsing**: Save files (.d2s for characters, .d2i for shared stash) are parsed
4. **Item Extraction**: All items in inventories, equipped slots, and stashes are extracted
5. **Grail Matching**: Items are compared against the Holy Grail database
6. **Progress Update**: New Grail items are marked as found
7. **Notification**: You're notified of new discoveries (if enabled)

#### What Gets Detected

The tracker automatically detects items in:

- **Character Inventory**: Items your character is carrying
- **Character Equipped**: Items your character has equipped
- **Character Stash**: Personal stash tabs
- **Shared Stash**: All shared stash tabs
- **Cube**: Items in Horadric Cube

#### Detection Triggers

The tracker updates when:

- You save and exit a character
- You modify the shared stash
- Save files are written to disk

#### Limitations and Notes

**Save File Timing:**

- Items are detected only when save files are written
- D2R writes save files when you exit a character
- Changes during gameplay aren't detected until exit
- Hardcore death saves immediately (items detected)

**Item Identification:**

- The tracker identifies items by their internal codes
- Unidentified items may not be properly detected until identified
- Item properties and stats are read from save file data

**Character Association:**

- The tracker records which character found each item
- Items moved between characters may show the most recent owner
- Shared stash items are attributed to "shared_stash"

### Manual Entry Mode

For situations where automatic detection isn't possible or preferred, use manual entry mode.

#### When to Use Manual Entry

**Platform Limitations:**

- Playing on console without save file access
- Using cloud gaming services
- Playing on platforms where save files aren't accessible

**Multiple Accounts:**

- Tracking items across different Battle.net accounts
- Combining progress from multiple installations
- Sharing a tracker with other players

**Special Scenarios:**

- Theorycrafting and planning your Grail
- Recording historical finds from before using the tracker
