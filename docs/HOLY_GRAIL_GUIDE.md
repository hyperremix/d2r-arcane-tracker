## Introduction

### What is the Holy Grail Challenge?

The **Holy Grail** is one of the most prestigious endgame challenges in Diablo II: Resurrected. The goal is deceptively simple: find every unique and set item that can drop in the game through legitimate gameplay. Unlike other endgame goals that focus on character optimization or speed-running, the Holy Grail is a marathon of exploration, farming, and persistence.

The challenge requires:

- **Self-found items only** - Items must be found by your own characters
- **No trading** - Trading defeats the purpose of the challenge
- **No dupes** - Only legitimately dropped items count
- **Completion** - Finding every single unique and set item in the game

The traditional Holy Grail focuses on unique and set items, though many players extend the challenge to include runes and runewords as well.

### Why Pursue the Holy Grail?

Players undertake the Holy Grail challenge for several compelling reasons:

#### Long-term Goal

Unlike completing the game or reaching level 99, the Holy Grail provides a concrete, achievable (though difficult) long-term objective that can take hundreds or even thousands of hours to complete.

#### Comprehensive Game Experience

The challenge forces you to:

- Farm all areas of the game
- Build multiple characters for different farming routes
- Experience the full depth of D2R's item system
- Master magic find optimization
- Learn monster and area mechanics

#### Community Recognition

Completing the Holy Grail is recognized as a significant achievement in the D2R community. Many players share their progress through streams, videos, or tracker screenshots.

#### Personal Satisfaction

There's an undeniable satisfaction in:

- Finally finding that last elusive item
- Watching your completion percentage slowly climb
- Hitting major milestones (50%, 75%, 90%, etc.)
- The dopamine rush when a rare unique drops

#### Replayability

The challenge gives purpose to farming runs that might otherwise feel repetitive. Each run is a chance to check another item off the list.

### History and Community

The Holy Grail challenge originated in the classic Diablo II community and has been a staple endgame pursuit for over two decades.

#### Origins

- The term "Holy Grail" was coined by the D2 community to represent the ultimate collection quest
- Early trackers were simple spreadsheets or text files
- Players would manually check off items as they found them
- The challenge gained popularity through forums like Diabloii.net and Reddit's r/diablo2

#### Modern Era

With Diablo II: Resurrected, the Holy Grail has experienced a renaissance:

- Automated tracking tools like D2R Arcane Tracker have made progress tracking seamless
- Streaming platforms have brought more visibility to Grail runs
- The remaster's improved graphics make rare items even more exciting to find
- Cross-platform play has expanded the community of Grail hunters

#### Notable Achievements

- Some players have completed multiple Grails across different game modes
- Hardcore Holy Grails are considered especially challenging due to character permadeath
- "Speedrun Grails" where players race to complete the Grail as quickly as possible have emerged
- The community celebrates major item finds, especially the rarest drops

---

## Holy Grail Categories

The D2R Arcane Tracker organizes Holy Grail items into several main categories. Understanding these categories helps you track progress and target specific items.

### Unique Items

**Unique items** are the core of the Holy Grail challenge. These are one-of-a-kind items with fixed stats and unique properties.

#### Characteristics

- Orange/gold text color in-game
- Fixed names (e.g., Shako, Windforce, Stone of Jordan)
- Predetermined stats with minor variance
- Can drop from monsters within their treasure class
- Some can only drop from specific monsters or areas

#### Quantity

There are over 300 unique items in Diablo II: Resurrected, spanning all equipment slots and item types.

#### Rarity Spectrum

Unique items range from:

- **Common**: Frequently found during normal gameplay (e.g., Hotspur, Sigon's set pieces)
- **Rare**: Require dedicated farming (e.g., Harlequin Crest, War Traveler)
- **Very Rare**: Exceptionally difficult to find (e.g., Azurewrath, Death's Web)
- **Extremely Rare**: Can take thousands of hours (e.g., Tyrael's Might, Mang Song's Lesson)

The tracker categorizes these items by weapon type, armor type, jewelry, and charms for easier organization.

### Set Items

**Set items** are green-colored items that provide additional bonuses when worn together as a complete set.

#### Characteristics

- Green text color in-game
- Belong to named sets (e.g., Tal Rasha's Wrappings, Immortal King)
- Individual pieces provide standard bonuses
- Wearing multiple pieces from the same set grants set bonuses
- Full set completion often provides powerful synergies

#### Organization

The tracker organizes set items by:

- **Set name**: All pieces from the same set are grouped together
- **Item type**: Categorized by whether they're weapons, armor, or jewelry
- **Completion status**: Easily see which sets you've completed

#### Total Count

There are approximately 30 item sets in D2R, with varying numbers of pieces per set (typically 2-6 items per set).

#### Rarity

Set items also vary in rarity:

- Some sets are commonly found (Sigon's, Cleglaw's)
- Others require significant farming (Tal Rasha's, Immortal King)
- A few pieces are extremely rare (e.g., Griswold's Honor)

### Runes

**Runes** are socketable items that can be combined to create runewords. They're optional for Holy Grail tracking but many purists include them.

#### Why Track Runes?

- Completes the "find everything" goal
- Runes are integral to D2R's endgame
- High runes are exceptionally rare and valuable
- Adds significant challenge to the Grail

#### Rune Hierarchy

Runes are organized from El (#1) to Zod (#33):

- **Low Runes** (El through Amn): Common drops
- **Mid Runes** (Sol through Mal): Moderate rarity
- **High Runes** (Ist through Zod): Rare and extremely valuable

#### Tracking Considerations

In D2R Arcane Tracker, you can enable or disable rune tracking based on your preference. Many players:

- Track high runes only (Ist+)
- Track all runes for completeness
- Skip runes to focus on uniques and sets

### Runewords

**Runewords** are created by inserting specific runes in a specific order into socketed items. Like runes, they're optional for tracking.

#### Why Track Runewords?

- Represents crafting achievements
- Shows mastery of the runeword system
- Adds a crafting dimension to the Grail
- Some runewords are build-defining

#### Considerations

Runewords differ from other Grail items:

- They're **crafted**, not found
- Requires having specific runes
- Requires appropriate base items
- Can be created multiple times

#### Tracking in D2R Arcane Tracker

The tracker allows you to mark runewords as "created" when you successfully craft them, providing a separate collection goal beyond finding items.

## Using D2R Arcane Tracker

D2R Arcane Tracker automates the Holy Grail tracking process, monitoring your save files and updating your progress as you play.

### Initial Setup

When you first launch D2R Arcane Tracker, you'll need to configure it to monitor your Diablo II: Resurrected save files.

#### Locating Your Save Directory

```
%USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected
```

Typical full path:

```
C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected
```

#### Configuration Steps

1. **Launch the Application**: Open D2R Arcane Tracker
2. **Navigate to Settings**: Click the Settings icon (gear icon)
3. **Find Database Settings**: Look for the save file directory configuration
4. **Browse to Your Save Directory**: Click "Browse" or "Select Folder"
5. **Confirm the Path**: Ensure the path points to the folder containing your `.d2s` character files
6. **Apply Settings**: Save your configuration

#### Verifying Setup

Once configured, the tracker should:

- Detect existing characters
- Display them in the character list
- Show any items already in their inventories and stashes
- Begin monitoring for changes

If characters don't appear:

- Double-check the save directory path
- Ensure you have at least one character created in D2R
- Check file permissions (the tracker needs read access)
- Restart the application

### Game Mode Configuration

D2R Arcane Tracker supports multiple game modes to accommodate different playstyles.

#### Available Game Modes

**Both Softcore & Hardcore**

- Tracks items from all characters regardless of hardcore status
- Ideal for players who play both modes
- Provides the most comprehensive tracking
- Default recommended setting

**Softcore Only**

- Tracks only items from softcore (non-hardcore) characters
- For players who exclusively play softcore
- Filters out any hardcore character items

**Hardcore Only**

- Tracks only items from hardcore characters
- For dedicated hardcore Holy Grail runners
- More challenging due to permadeath risk
- Separates hardcore achievements from softcore

**Manual Entry**

- Disables automatic save file monitoring
- Allows manual item entry only
- Useful for:
  - Tracking items across multiple accounts
  - Playing on platforms without save file access
  - Theorycrafting or planning
  - Tracking found items without automatic detection

#### Changing Game Mode

1. Open **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Game Mode** section
3. Select your preferred mode from the dropdown
4. Changes take effect immediately
5. Progress statistics will update to reflect the selected mode

#### Important Considerations

- Changing game modes affects what items are counted toward completion
- Switching from "Both" to "Softcore Only" will hide hardcore-found items (but not delete them)
- Manual mode disables automatic detection entirely
- You can change modes at any time without losing data

### Game Version Selection

The tracker supports both modern and classic versions of Diablo II.

#### Available Versions

**Diablo II: Resurrected**

- Modern remaster with enhanced graphics
- Updated save file format
- Quality of life improvements
- Default setting for most users
- Full feature support

**Diablo II: Classic**

- Original Diablo II with Lord of Destruction
- Legacy save file format
- For players still on the original game
- Compatible with older save files

#### Version Differences

The game version setting affects:

- Save file parsing compatibility
- Item detection algorithms
- Expected file formats
- Treasure class data

#### Selecting Your Version

1. Open **Settings**
2. Find **Game Version** section
3. Choose between Resurrected or Classic
4. The tracker will adjust its parsing accordingly

**Note**: Most users should select "Diablo II: Resurrected" unless specifically playing the original game.

### Tracking Options

Customize what types of items count toward your Holy Grail completion.

#### Normal Items (Default: Enabled)

The standard Holy Grail includes all unique and set items in their normal (non-ethereal) form.

- **Enabled**: Track all normal unique and set items
- **Recommended**: Always enabled for traditional Holy Grail

#### Ethereal Items (Default: Disabled)

Ethereal items are special versions with +50% defense (armor) or damage (weapons) but cannot be repaired (unless they have self-repair property).

**Tracking Options:**

- **Disabled**: Don't track ethereal variants (traditional Grail)
- **Enabled**: Track ethereal versions separately

**Considerations for Ethereal Tracking:**

- Roughly doubles the number of items to find
- Significantly increases challenge difficulty
- Some items can only drop ethereal (these always count)

**How Ethereal Tracking Works:**

- Some items can have both normal and ethereal versions
- The tracker shows separate checkboxes or indicators
- You need to find both versions for 100% completion

#### Runes (Default: Disabled)

Enable rune tracking to include all 33 runes in your Grail.

**When to Enable:**

- You want a complete "find everything" challenge
- High rune farming is part of your goals
- You enjoy the additional tracking dimension

**When to Disable:**

- You prefer the traditional unique/set-only Grail
- Runes feel too numerous or common
- You want to focus on equipment items only

**Tracking Behavior:**

- Tracks runes from El (#1) to Zod (#33)
- Each rune only needs to be found once
- Runes in your stash/inventory are automatically detected
- Progress percentage includes runes when enabled

#### Runewords (Default: Disabled)

Track crafted runewords as part of your collection.

**When to Enable:**

- You enjoy the crafting aspect of D2R
- You want to document your runeword achievements
- You collect perfect or notable runeword bases

**When to Disable:**

- You prefer self-found items only
- Runewords feel like "cheating" since they're crafted
- You want to focus on finding, not making

**Tracking Behavior:**

- Tracks which runewords you've successfully made
- Progress percentage includes runewords when enabled

#### Customizing Your Grail

Common configurations:

- **Traditional**: Normal items only, no runes/runewords
- **Extended**: Normal + Ethereal items
- **Complete**: Everything including runes
- **Purist**: Uniques and sets only, no runes/runewords
- **Custom**: Any combination that suits your goals

Changes to tracking options update your progress statistics immediately.

### Automatic Item Detection

The tracker's most powerful feature is automatic detection of items from your save files.

#### How It Works

1. **File Monitoring**: The tracker continuously monitors your save file directory
2. **Change Detection**: When save files are modified, the tracker detects changes
3. **File Parsing**: Save files (.d2s for characters, .d2i for shared stash) are parsed
4. **Item Extraction**: All items in inventories, equipped slots, and stashes are extracted
5. **Grail Matching**: Items are compared against the Holy Grail database
6. **Progress Update**: New Grail items are marked as found
7. **Notification**: You're notified of new discoveries (if enabled)

#### What Gets Detected

The tracker automatically detects items in:

- **Character Inventory**: Items your character is carrying
- **Character Equipped**: Items your character has equipped
- **Character Stash**: Personal stash tabs
- **Shared Stash**: All shared stash tabs
- **Cube**: Items in Horadric Cube

#### Detection Triggers

The tracker updates when:

- You save and exit a character
- You modify the shared stash
- Save files are written to disk

#### Limitations and Notes

**Save File Timing:**

- Items are detected only when save files are written
- D2R writes save files when you exit a character
- Changes during gameplay aren't detected until exit
- Hardcore death saves immediately (items detected)

**Item Identification:**

- The tracker identifies items by their internal codes
- Unidentified items may not be properly detected until identified
- Item properties and stats are read from save file data

**Character Association:**

- The tracker records which character found each item
- Items moved between characters may show the most recent owner
- Shared stash items are attributed to "shared_stash"

### Manual Entry Mode

For situations where automatic detection isn't possible or preferred, use manual entry mode.

#### When to Use Manual Entry

**Platform Limitations:**

- Playing on console without save file access
- Using cloud gaming services
- Playing on platforms where save files aren't accessible

**Multiple Accounts:**

- Tracking items across different Battle.net accounts
- Combining progress from multiple installations
- Sharing a tracker with other players

**Special Scenarios:**

- Theorycrafting and planning your Grail
- Recording historical finds from before using the tracker

**Preference:**

- You prefer manual control over tracking
- You want to verify each item personally
- You're concerned about false positives

#### Enabling Manual Mode

1. Open **Settings**
2. Select **Game Mode**
3. Choose **Manual Entry**
4. Automatic detection is now disabled

#### Adding Items Manually

While in manual mode (or with manual entry available):

1. **Navigate to the Item**: Find the item in the Grail tracker interface
2. **Mark as Found**: Click the item or its checkbox
3. **Optional Details**: Add notes, character, difficulty, date
4. **Save**: Confirm the entry

#### Manual Entry Fields

When manually adding items, you can specify:

- **Character**: Which character found the item (optional)
- **Found Date**: When the item was found
- **Difficulty**: Normal, Nightmare, or Hell
- **Is Ethereal**: Whether the item is ethereal
- **Notes**: Personal notes about the find

#### Editing and Removing Entries

Manual entries can be:

- **Edited**: Change details like character or date
- **Removed**: Delete if added by mistake
- **Annotated**: Add or update notes

### Run Tracker Overview

The Run Tracker is a dedicated workspace for logging every farming session and the individual runs inside them. While the Holy Grail tracker focuses on *what* you have found, the Run Tracker adds context by capturing *when* and *during which run* the items dropped.

- Start a **session** before you begin farming.
- Each run (every time you enter a game) records start/end times, character, duration, and loot.
- Review or export sessions later for progress reports or community posts.
- Data persists locally, so you can safely delete in-game items after they're detected.

📖 For a deep dive, read the [Run Tracker Guide](RUN_TRACKER.md).

### Sessions and Runs

- **Sessions**: Manual constructs that represent a block of playtime. You decide when to start/end.
- **Runs**: Automatically or manually created whenever you enter/exit a game. A session can include dozens of runs.
- **Run Items**: Loot discovered during each run, tied back to Grail progress entries.
- **Session Notes**: Add quick descriptors (“TZ rotation”, “Key farming”) to help categorize sessions later.

The Run Tracker UI provides a Session Card, Run Controls, sessions list, and a detailed view with per-run breakdowns.

### Automatic vs Manual Tracking

You can track runs in two ways:

1. **Automatic (Memory Reading)**
   - Windows-only feature powered by the memory reader service.
   - Enable “Auto Mode” in Settings → Run Tracker.
   - Requires valid offsets (shipped with the app) and D2R running.
   - Automatically starts a run when you enter a game and ends it when you exit.

2. **Manual Controls**
   - Available on all platforms.
   - Use the Run Tracker tab buttons or the global keyboard shortcuts listed below.
   - Helpful for correcting auto mode or recording console runs.

You can mix both approaches: keep auto mode enabled for convenience and fall back to manual commands whenever needed.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Configure shortcuts via Settings → Run Tracker (defaults shown below):

- `Ctrl+R` — Start Run
- `Ctrl+Space` — Pause/Resume Run
- `Ctrl+E` — End Run
- `Ctrl+Shift+E` — End Session

Choose combinations that do not conflict with operating-system hotkeys. Shortcuts trigger even when the Run Tracker tab isn't focused, making it easy to control runs mid-farm.

### Linking Runs to Holy Grail Progress

The Run Tracker listens for new Grail discoveries and attaches them to the active run:

- When the save-file monitor detects a new unique/set/rune, it logs the item in the current run automatically.
- Manual item entry in the Run Tracker can be used for console drops or historical backfills.
- Each item record references both the run and the Grail database entry, so you can answer questions like “Which run produced Tyrael's Might?” at any time.

Combining the Grail dashboard with run history gives you richer analytics—overall completion percentages plus run-by-run provenance and efficiency metrics.

### Progress Tracking Interface

The tracker provides multiple ways to view and filter your Holy Grail progress.

#### Main Dashboard

The dashboard shows:

- **Overall Progress**: Total completion percentage
- **Category Breakdown**: Progress by category (weapons, armor, etc.)
- **Recent Finds**: Recently discovered items
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive progress metrics

#### Item Grid View

The grid displays all Grail items as cards:

- **Found Items**: Highlighted or marked with a checkmark
- **Missing Items**: Shown in a different style (grayed out, outlined)
- **Item Details**: Name, image, category visible at a glance
- **Quick Actions**: Click for details or to mark manually

#### Filtering Options

Filter items by:

- **Category**: Weapons, Armor, Jewelry, Charms, Runes, Runewords
- **Subcategory**: Specific weapon types, armor types, etc.
- **Type**: Unique, Set, Rune, Runeword
- **Found Status**: All items, Found only, Missing only
- **Difficulty**: Items that can drop in Normal, Nightmare, Hell
- **Rarity**: Common, Rare, Very Rare, Extremely Rare

#### Search Functionality

The search feature allows:

- **Text Search**: Search by item name
- **Fuzzy Search**: Find items with similar names
- **Code Search**: Search by internal item codes
- **Set Search**: Find all items from a specific set

#### Sorting Options

Sort items by:

- **Name**: Alphabetical order
- **Category**: Group by equipment type
- **Rarity**: Sort by how rare items are
- **Required Level**: Sort by level requirement
- **Found Date**: Recently found items first
- **Character**: Group by which character found items

#### Item Details View

Click any item to see:

- **Item Statistics**: Damage, defense, bonuses, etc.
- **Drop Information**: Where it can drop, treasure class
- **Find History**: When found, which character, difficulty
- **Ethereal Status**: Whether you've found normal/ethereal versions
- **Notes**: Any personal notes you've added
- **External Links**: Links to wikis or databases (if available)

#### Customizing the View

Customize your interface:

- **Grid vs List**: Toggle between grid cards and list view
- **Item Icons**: Show or hide item images
- **Compact Mode**: Reduce spacing for more items on screen
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for found/missing/recent

#### Item Icon Management

The tracker can display actual D2R item icons for a more immersive experience. This feature requires extracting game files from your D2R installation.

**CASC File Extraction Required:**

D2R stores item icon files in CASC (Content Addressable Storage Container) format. Before you can use item icons in the tracker, these files must be extracted:

1. Download [Ladik's CASC Viewer](https://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html)
2. Open the x64 version (or appropriate version for your OS)
3. In CASC Viewer, click "Open Storage"
4. Select your D2R folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected`)
5. Click "data" on the left side, then click "data" again and click "Extract"
6. Wait for extraction to complete (~40GB: global, hd, local folders)
7. Move the 3 extracted folders to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected\Data`
8. After extraction, use the "Convert Sprite Files to PNG" button in Settings

**Important Notes:**

- Extraction is a one-time process (unless game updates add new items)
- The extraction does not modify your game installation
- Converted PNG images are stored in the app's data directory
- Item icons are optional - the tracker works perfectly without them

**Converting to PNG:**

After extracting the CASC files:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Item Icon Management**
2. Click "Convert Sprite Files to PNG"
3. Wait for the conversion to complete
4. Enable "Show Item Icons" toggle to display icons in item cards

### Runeword Calculator

The Runeword Calculator is a powerful tool that helps you determine which runewords you can craft based on your current rune inventory. It works independently of the grailRunewords tracking setting, making it useful for all players regardless of whether they track runewords as part of their Holy Grail.

#### Accessing the Calculator

Navigate to the Runeword Calculator by clicking the **calculator icon** in the top navigation bar (between Statistics and Settings).

#### How It Works

When you open the Runeword Calculator:

1. **Automatic Scan**: The app scans your save files to get your current rune inventory
2. **Displays All Runewords**: Shows all 93 runewords from Diablo II: Resurrected
3. **Real-time Status**: Each runeword card shows whether you can craft it based on available runes

#### Features

**Search by Name:**

- Type in the search box to filter runewords by name
- Case-insensitive substring matching
- Quickly find specific runewords like "Enigma" or "Infinity"

**Filter by Runes:**

- Each rune (El through Zod) has a checkbox in the left sidebar
- Rune images are displayed for easy visual identification
- Rune counts show how many of each rune you have
- Red highlighting indicates runes you don't have (count: 0)
- Select runes to see which runewords use them

**Show Partial Toggle:**

- **ON (default)**: Shows all runewords matching your filters
- **OFF**: Shows only runewords you can fully craft (have all required runes)

**Visual Indicators:**

Each runeword card displays:

- **Runeword Name**: The name of the runeword
- **Required Runes**: Visual display of all required runes with images
- **Completion Status**: Green checkmark if you can craft (all runes available)
- **Missing Runes**: List of which specific runes you're missing

#### Smart Rune Display

The calculator intelligently handles duplicate rune requirements:

- If a runeword requires 2 Ber runes and you have 1, it shows:
  - ✅ First Ber (available, normal appearance)
  - ❌ Second Ber (missing, red background)
- This makes it easy to see exactly which runes you still need to find

#### Use Cases

**Planning Your Builds:**

- See what runewords you can make with your current rune collection
- Decide which runes to save vs. use
- Plan which runes to farm next

**Rune Management:**

- Get a quick overview of your rune inventory
- See how many of each rune you have across all characters
- Identify which runes are bottlenecks for desired runewords

#### Tips

- Use the "Show Partial" toggle OFF to see only craftable runewords
- Select specific high-value runes (Jah, Ber, Sur) to see premium runeword options
- Check the calculator before making runeword decisions to avoid wasting runes

### Terror Zone Configuration

D2R Arcane Tracker includes a powerful feature that allows you to customize which terror zones are active in your Diablo II: Resurrected installation. This feature modifies the game's `desecratedzones.json` file to enable or disable specific terror zones according to your preferences.

#### What are Terror Zones?

Terror Zones are special areas in Diablo II: Resurrected that rotate on a schedule, providing enhanced monster levels and better loot drops. The terror zone system includes 36 different zones across all acts of the game.

#### Accessing Terror Zone Configuration

Navigate to the Terror Zone Configuration by clicking the **alert triangle icon** in the top navigation bar (between Runeword Calculator and Settings).

#### Key Features

**Zone Management:**

- **Enable/Disable Individual Zones**: Toggle specific terror zones on or off
- **"Only" Buttons**: Enable only a specific zone while disabling all others
- **Global Controls**: "Enable All" and "Disable All" buttons for quick management
- **Search Functionality**: Find specific zones by name
- **Zone Details**: View which levels are included in each terror zone

**Safety Features:**

- **Automatic Backup**: Creates a backup of the original game file before any modifications
- **Restore Functionality**: Restore the original configuration at any time
- **Validation**: Checks that your D2R installation path is correct and the game file exists
- **Warning System**: Clear warnings about game file modification and restart requirements

#### How It Works

1. **File Extraction**: Extract all game files from CASC archives using Ladik's CASC Viewer
2. **Launch with `-txt` Flag**: D2R must be launched with the `-txt` flag to use extracted files
3. **File Location**: The feature modifies `{D2R Installation}/Data/hd/global/excel/desecratedzones.json`
4. **Backup Creation**: On first use, creates an immutable backup in the app's data directory
5. **Configuration Storage**: Your zone preferences are stored in the app's database
6. **Game File Modification**: The app writes your selected zones to the game's configuration file
7. **Restart Required**: Changes take effect after restarting Diablo II: Resurrected with the `-txt` flag

#### Important Considerations

**Game File Extraction Required:**

D2R stores game files in CASC (Content Addressable Storage Container) format. **All game files must be extracted** for this feature to work.

**Extraction Steps:**

1. Download [Ladik's CASC Viewer](https://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html)
2. Open the x64 version (or appropriate version for your OS)
3. In CASC Viewer, click "Open Storage"
4. Select your D2R folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected`)
5. Click "data" on the left side, then click "data" again and click "Extract"
6. Wait for ~40GB extraction (global, hd, local folders)
7. Move the 3 extracted folders to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected\Data` (top-most Data folder)
8. Create a D2R shortcut and add `-txt` to the target (e.g., `"D2R.exe" -txt`)
9. Always launch D2R using this shortcut

**Game File Modification:**

- This feature directly modifies game files in your D2R installation
- Always ensure D2R is closed before making changes
- The original file is automatically backed up and can be restored
- Any issues related to these changes are your responsibility

**Restart Requirements:**

- Changes require restarting Diablo II: Resurrected to take effect
- The app will remind you of this requirement
- Terror zone schedules will update based on your configuration

**Backup Safety:**

- The backup file is never modified and remains as a safety net
- You can restore the original configuration at any time
- The backup is stored in the app's user data directory

#### Use Cases

**Focused Farming:**

- Enable only zones that drop items you're hunting for
- Disable zones that don't interest you
- Create custom terror zone rotations

**Testing and Experimentation:**

- Try different zone combinations
- Test specific farming strategies
- Experiment with zone preferences

**Streaming and Content Creation:**

- Create predictable terror zone schedules
- Focus on specific areas for content
- Customize the experience for your audience

#### Safety and Best Practices

**Before Making Changes:**

- Ensure Diablo II: Resurrected is completely closed
- Verify your D2R installation path is correct
- Consider backing up your save files as an extra precaution
