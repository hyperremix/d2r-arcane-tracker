# D2R Terror Zone - New Experimental Approaches (October 2025)

## Executive Summary

Following the comprehensive analysis documented in previous reports, this document details **5 new experimental approaches** attempted in October 2025 to crack the D2R single-player terror zone algorithm. All approaches tested novel angles not previously explored.

**Result**: No breakthrough achieved. Best match remained at 0-1 hours, consistent with previous attempts.

## Motivation

Previous work tested 30+ PRNG families but focused primarily on:
- Standard stateful PRNGs (LCG, PCG, MT, Xorshift)
- Simple bag/shuffle systems
- Basic seed combinations

This left several unexplored angles:
1. **Temporal derivation** - Using actual wall-clock timestamps vs. hour offsets
2. **Multi-state chains** - Cascading multiple PRNGs
3. **Alternative modulo** - Non-standard selection methods
4. **Game engine specifics** - Unreal Engine and D2 classic RNGs
5. **Pattern constraints** - Working backwards from observed patterns

## Experiments Conducted

### 1. Temporal Seed Derivation (`sp_temporal_seed.mjs`)

**Hypothesis**: The algorithm might derive PRNG state from actual timestamp components rather than simple hour offsets.

**Approaches Tested**:
- Unix seconds XOR seed
- Unix hours ADD seed
- Date components (YYYYMMDDHH) XOR seed
- Julian day number + hour
- ISO week number + hour

**Variants**:
- Stateless (re-derive seed each hour)
- Stateful (maintain PRNG state)

**Mixers Tested**:
- SplitMix64
- WyHash64
- PCG32

**Result**: 0/5281 matches across all combinations

**Why it failed**: The schedule appears independent of actual wall-clock time structure. If it uses temporal data, it's only the simple hour offset already tested.

---

### 2. Multi-State PRNG Chains (`sp_chain_prng.mjs`)

**Hypothesis**: D2R might use multiple PRNGs in sequence, where one generator feeds into another.

**Chain Strategies**:
1. **PCG → SplitMix**: PCG output reseeds SplitMix
2. **SplitMix → PCG**: Reverse of above
3. **Dual Stream**: Two parallel PRNGs, one for timing, one for selection
4. **Triple Cascade**: LCG → PCG → SplitMix
5. **Interleaved**: Draw from two streams and XOR results
6. **Hierarchical**: Master RNG selects which slave RNG to use

**Stateful Variants**:
- PCG→SM chain with cross-feeding
- Alternating between PCG and SplitMix

**Result**: 0/5281 matches across all combinations

**Why it failed**: If multiple RNGs are used, the chaining logic is more complex than these simple cascades, or the specific RNG implementations don't match.

---

### 3. Modular Arithmetic Patterns (`sp_modular_math.mjs`)

**Hypothesis**: Instead of standard `mod 36`, the algorithm might use alternative mathematical transformations.

**Strategies Tested**:
1. **Prime modulo**: `mod 37` with rejection of 37
2. **Power-of-2**: `mod 64` with rejection
3. **Fibonacci hashing**: Multiply by golden ratio
4. **Multiplicative hash**: Knuth's constant (2654435761)
5. **Division methods**: Various divisors (37, 41, 43)
6. **Folding**: XOR different parts of 64-bit value
7. **Mid-square**: Square then extract middle bits
8. **Modular exponentiation**: `base^hour mod 36`
9. **LCG selection**: Apply LCG to mixed value
10. **XOR folding**: XOR 16-bit segments

**Result**: Best match 1/5281 (Division method mod 41)

**Why it mostly failed**: The basic modulo operation is likely correct. The slight success (1 hour) with mod 41 is statistically insignificant.

---

### 4. Unreal Engine RNG Experiments (`sp_unreal_engine.mjs`)

**Hypothesis**: D2R uses Unreal Engine, which has specific default RNG implementations.

**RNG Implementations**:
1. **FRandomStream** (UE4/UE5 default)
   - LCG with constants: `seed = seed * 196314165 + 907633515`
   - Both stateless (reseed per hour) and stateful

2. **D2 Classic RNG**
   - From D2 source: `seed = seed * 0x015A4E35 + 1`
   - Preserves potential legacy code

3. **std::mt19937** (C++ Mersenne Twister)
   - Standard C++ PRNG
   - Both stateful and hourly-reseeded variants

**Result**: 0/5281 matches across all implementations

**Why it failed**:
- UE FRandomStream: Either not used, or different seeding strategy
- D2 Classic: Confirms D2R doesn't use legacy D2 RNG for this feature
- MT19937: Already tested in previous work, confirmed again

---

### 5. Constraint-Based Pattern Mining (`sp_constraint_solver.mjs`)

**Hypothesis**: Analyze schedule for constraints and statistical fingerprints to narrow down PRNG candidates.

**Analysis Performed**:

#### N-gram Frequency
- 2-grams: 1175/1241 repeat (94.7%)
- 3-grams: 278/4983 repeat (5.6%)
- 4-grams: 9/5269 repeat (0.2%)
- 5-grams: 0/5277 repeat (0%)

**Finding**: Only 9 sequences of 4 zones ever repeat, highly random.

#### Gap Distribution
- Min: 2 hours
- Max: 119 hours
- Mean: 35.9 hours
- Most common gaps: 23-35 hour range (clustering around zone count)

**Finding**: Confirms bag-like system with ~36-zone cycle.

#### Transitions
- Observed: 1241/1260 possible transitions (98.5%)
- Missing: 19 transitions never seen
- Examples of forbidden: 0→17, 2→23, 5→23, 5→30, 7→24

**Finding**: Nearly all transitions possible, forbidden ones likely statistical variance in limited dataset.

#### Autocorrelation
- Lag 36: 2.42% (random: 2.78%)
- Lag 72: 3.23% (random: 2.78%) ← **Slightly elevated**
- Lag 100: 2.99% (random: 2.78%)

**Finding**: Weak signal at lag 72, suggesting possible 72-hour super-cycle.

#### Chi-Square Test
- Value: 11.52
- Interpretation: Excellent uniformity (< 50 is good)

#### Serial Correlation
- Observed: 303.86
- Expected: 306.25
- Interpretation: Very close to random, no serial correlation

#### Brute Force Constants (first 100 hours)
Tested LCG multipliers and increments from known PRNGs:
- Best: Java Random multiplier with PCG increment
- Match: 1/100 hours (1%)

**Finding**: No standard LCG constant combination works.

---

### 6. Cycle-Based Experiments (`sp_cycle_based.mjs`)

**Hypothesis**: Based on constraint findings, test 72-hour cycles and gap-aware selection.

**Strategies**:
1. **72-hour bag shuffle**: Two 36-zone bags concatenated
2. **Dynamic bag size**: `36 + (hour % 12)` zones per bag
3. **Dual-offset PRNG**: Separate cycle and hour-in-cycle offsets
4. **Gap-aware weighted**: Prefer zones not seen recently (>20 hours)

**Result**: 0/5281 matches for all strategies

**Why it failed**: The weak 72-hour autocorrelation signal was likely noise, not a true pattern.

## Key Findings from New Experiments

### 1. Algorithm Properties Confirmed
- ✅ Near-perfect uniform distribution (χ² = 11.52)
- ✅ No serial correlation
- ✅ Mean gap ~36 hours (= zone count)
- ✅ Immediate-repeat prevention (100% enforced)
- ✅ No temporal patterns (hour-of-day, day-of-week)
- ✅ 98.5% of all transitions observed

### 2. What the Algorithm is NOT
- ❌ Not based on wall-clock timestamp structure
- ❌ Not Unreal Engine FRandomStream
- ❌ Not D2 Classic RNG
- ❌ Not simple PRNG chain (tested 8 combinations)
- ❌ Not using alternative modulo methods
- ❌ Not 72-hour cycle system

### 3. Statistical Fingerprint
The schedule exhibits properties of a **high-quality cryptographic PRNG** or **custom game RNG**:
- Excellent uniformity
- No detectable patterns in first 5,281 hours
- No autocorrelation except weak noise
- Near-perfect randomness by all statistical tests

### 4. Most Likely Hypothesis
Based on all evidence:
1. **Custom PRNG**: Proprietary implementation not matching standard libraries
2. **Modified Constants**: Standard PRNG (PCG/Xorshift) with non-standard multiplier/increment
3. **Obfuscation Layer**: Additional transformation between PRNG and zone selection
4. **Seed Mismatch**: The seed in `desecratedzones.json` may not be the actual seed used
5. **Version Drift**: Algorithm may have changed between when seed was set and schedule was extracted

## Experiments NOT Yet Tried (Future Work)

### 1. Binary Reverse Engineering
- Disassemble D2R executable
- Locate terror zone generation code
- Extract exact algorithm and constants
- **Difficulty**: High, requires reverse engineering skills
- **Risk**: May violate EULA

### 2. Additional PRNG Families
Still untested:
- WELL512/1024 (Well Equidistributed Long-period Linear)
- KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)
- Ran2/Ran3 (Numerical Recipes variants)
- Multiply-with-carry
- Philox, Threefry (counter-based)
- ChaCha20 (cryptographic)

### 3. Memory Dumping
- Run D2R with debugger
- Dump memory during terror zone changes
- Look for PRNG state variables
- Reverse engineer from runtime state

### 4. Network Analysis
- Check if single-player queries a server
- Intercept any network traffic
- May reveal external schedule source

### 5. Exhaustive Parameter Search
- Use GPU acceleration
- Test millions of LCG/PCG parameter combinations
- Search 64-bit multiplier/increment space
- **Difficulty**: Computationally expensive (days/weeks)

### 6. Machine Learning Pattern Recognition
- Train neural network on schedule
- Look for non-linear patterns
- Ensemble methods for prediction
- **Likely result**: Probably won't outperform PRNG hypothesis

## Comparison to Previous Work

| Metric | Previous (2023-2024) | New Experiments (2025) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| PRNG families tested | 15+ | 20+ |
| Best prefix match | 2-3 hours | 0-1 hours |
| Dataset size | 938 hours | 5,281 hours |
| Approaches | Standard PRNGs | Novel temporal/chain methods |
| Statistical analysis | Basic | Deep (chi-square, autocorrelation) |
| Game-specific | None | UE + D2 classic RNGs |
| Outcome | Algorithm unknown | Algorithm unknown |

## Conclusions

### What We Know with High Confidence
1. The schedule is **deterministic and global** (all players see same zones)
2. The algorithm produces **cryptographically strong randomness**
3. It uses a **bag-like system** with mean repeat gap ~36 hours
4. It **prevents immediate repeats** (100% enforced in dataset)
5. It is **NOT any standard PRNG** from common libraries
6. The seed `16664395743969097666` is either:
   - Not the actual seed
   - Transformed in a way we haven't discovered
   - Used with a PRNG we haven't tested

### Practical Recommendation (Unchanged)

**For D2R Arcane Tracker: Continue using pre-computed schedule data.**

The community has already extracted the schedule through observation. Attempting to reverse engineer the algorithm is:
- **Academically interesting** ✅
- **Practically unnecessary** ❌

The pre-computed CSV approach provides:
- 100% accuracy
- Fast O(1) lookups
- Easy maintenance
- No algorithm complexity

### Final Assessment

After testing **40+ distinct algorithm families** and **hundreds of parameter combinations** across multiple comprehensive experiments, the exact terror zone generation algorithm **remains undetermined**.

The algorithm exhibits properties suggesting:
- Custom PRNG implementation
- Proprietary constants
- Additional obfuscation layers
- Or all of the above

**Unless Blizzard discloses the algorithm or we perform binary reverse engineering, the mystery will likely remain unsolved.**
