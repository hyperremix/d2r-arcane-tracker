# US-014: (Retired) Run Type Selector Component

## Status
This user story has been retired. The run tracker no longer categorizes runs by type, so the RunTypeSelector component and related persistence logic have been removed from the application.

## Notes
- Historical references to this component remain in previous release notes only.
- No new implementation work is required for this story.
- Analytics and exports now derive insights solely from overall run statistics without per-type breakdowns.
