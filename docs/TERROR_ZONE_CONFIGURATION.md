## Introduction

### What are Terror Zones?

Terror Zones are special areas in Diablo II: Resurrected that rotate on a schedule, providing enhanced monster levels and better loot drops. The terror zone system includes 36 different zones across all acts of the game, each containing multiple levels and waypoints.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Enhanced Monster Levels**: Monsters in terror zones are scaled to your character level
- **Better Loot Drops**: Increased chance for high-quality items and runes
- **Rotating Schedule**: Different zones become active on a rotating basis
- **All Acts Covered**: Terror zones span all five acts of the game

### Why Customize Terror Zones?

Customizing terror zones allows you to:

**Focus Your Farming:**

- Enable only zones that drop items you're hunting for
- Disable zones that don't interest you
- Create custom terror zone rotations

**Optimize Your Experience:**

- Avoid zones you find boring or inefficient
- Focus on areas with better monster density
- Target specific item types or runes

**Content Creation:**

- Create predictable schedules for streaming
- Focus on specific areas for content
- Customize the experience for your audience

**Testing and Experimentation:**

- Try different zone combinations
- Test specific farming strategies
