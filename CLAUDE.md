# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Diablo 2 Resurrected Arcane Tracker - an Electron application built with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project uses a dual-tsconfig setup for web (renderer) and Node.js (main) processes.

### Main Features

- **Holy Grail Tracking**: Track unique items, set items, runes, and runewords
- **Save File Monitoring**: Automatic detection and parsing of D2R save files
- **Runeword Calculator**: View all runewords and see which ones you can craft based on available runes
- **Terror Zone Configuration**: Customize which terror zones are active in your D2R installation
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Comprehensive analytics and progress tracking
- **Smart Notifications**: In-app and native notifications for new item discoveries

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend**: Electron main process (Node.js environment)
- **Build System**: Vite with electron-vite for development and building
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui components (New York style) using Radix UI primitives and class-variance-authority
- **Internationalization**: i18next with browser language detection
- **Code Quality**: Biome for linting, formatting, and static analysis
- **Package Manager**: Yarn (specified in packageManager field)

## TypeScript Configuration

- `tsconfig.json` - Web/renderer configuration (includes src/, electron/)
- `tsconfig.node.json` - Node.js configuration for build tools
- Both configs use path mapping `@/*` â†’ `./src/*` for imports

## Quick Start

```bash
# Development
yarn dev              # Start development server

# Code Quality (must pass before task completion)
yarn typecheck        # Type check both web and node
yarn run check        # Run all Biome checks
yarn lint             # Lint only
yarn format           # Format check
yarn test:run         # Run all tests

# Build
yarn build            # Full production build
```

- State management with Zustand
- Electron main/renderer process communication
- Database operations and IPC handlers

## Key Development Notes

- The main process uses standard Node.js imports (no protocol enforcement)
- Renderer process enforces Node.js import protocols
- Uses ESM modules throughout
- Vite handles HMR for renderer, electron-vite handles main process reloading
- The app icon is located at `public/logo.png`
